I really want to work in the IT industry.I just started learning programming, now I am studying it at RSschool.  I have passed HTML Basics, CSS Basics, JS Basics. 

I graduated from the Belarusian State Technological University with a degree in tourism and environmental management.
For the last 3 years I have been working in a travel agency. I help people find the perfect vacation for them, book package tours, as well as flights and hotels. There are so many hotels of different star and budget categories, and my task is to find exactly what people want. My job involves the ability to quickly analyze and navigate a large flow of information, to find the best options.

# My main skills and abilities:  
multitasking  
stress resistance
processing a large amount of information  
sociability  
the ability to find an approach to people  
teamwork  
positivity  

My level of English is not high for spoken English, but sufficient for understanding the text and professional literature.
